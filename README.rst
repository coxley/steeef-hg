steeef-hg
=========

This theme will change prompt in hg repos. The default steeef totally supports
this by just adding to your zshrc::

    zstyle ':vcs_info:*' enable git svn hg

However this stands out more for me without bothering to customize the vcs_info
template. In the future I'll likely use `vcs_info`_ for something more flexible
